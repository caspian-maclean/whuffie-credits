Link to my Google+ post about goals for the system

Make an interaction log with the programs, demonstrating which goals it does and doesn't fulfill.

Link to related fiction and non-fiction about alternative monetary systems.

Upload explanatory pseudocode or program structure document

In one of the session logs, I suggest not agreeing to debit all / most of someone's whuffie, as that reduces the ways that a favour can be paid back. Pick a way to measure when this is going to happen, so the parties involved can choose to avoid it if desired. Otherwise you might end up accidentally doing it in multiple small transactions, none of which individually debit most of someone's whuffie.

Maybe later
-----------

Test how many people and transactions the program can handle before getting slow.

Make the program robust against bad transactions, specifically, debits or queries about previously unmentioned people.

Make some documentation with graphs, it would be easier to read.

Add reference to maximum flow problem, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem

Allow credits to decay according to some chosen half-life.

Done

Allow turning off the scaling of credits, to allow for simpler examples
