Example ideas:
We're turning off scaling for the initial examples, as it's simpler without that feature.
You can give someone whuffie, and see that they have it.
Give them some more, and see their whuffie has increased by that much
Whuffie is subjective, so a spammer giving another person whuffie only increases their whuffie from the spammer's point of view, not from yours.
Whuffie is transitive, so if you give someone some whuffie, and they give that to a third person, the third person has that amount of whuffie from your point of view.
But it's shared rather than transferred, so the intermediate person also still has it after they gave it to the third person
Giving part of their whuffie shares that much
Giving more whuffie than they got from you shares what they have


python2.6 -i whuffie-credits.py 
disable_scaling()

credit(amount=3.5, by="you", subject="someone")
query(by="you", subject="someone")

credit(amount=0.3, by="you", subject="someone")
query(by="you", subject="someone")

credit(amount=1000, by="spammer", subject="another")
query(by="spammer", subject="another")
query(by="you", subject="another")

credit(amount=5, by="you", subject="second")
credit(amount=5, by="second", subject="third")
query(by="you", subject="third")

query(by="you", subject="second")

credit(amount=5, by="you",subject="B")
credit(amount=3, by="B",subject="C")
query(by="you", subject="C")

credit(amount=5, by="you",subject="D")
credit(amount=7, by="D",subject="E")
query(by="you", subject="E")
